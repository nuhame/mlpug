# Dependencies for agentic LLM pretraining example
zstandard    # For reading zstd-compressed datasets (e.g., The Pile)
gitpython    # For git state logging (reproducibility)
rich         # For pretty-printing sample inspection and config logging
data-forager>=0.1.2  # For JSONL indexing, tokenization, and random access
tensorboard  # For training metrics visualization

# Transformers pinned to 4.x - liger-kernel 0.6.x is incompatible with transformers 5.x
# (transformers 5.x removed HybridCache from cache_utils, causing import errors)

# Liger Kernel for memory-efficient cross-entropy (critical for large vocabularies like Qwen3's 152K)
